# TuneSync
TuneSync: Song-to-Playlist Automator

Here’s a project timeline for your goal of identifying a song playing on your Pixel 8 and adding it to a Spotify playlist, assuming you only have weekends to work on this project:

### Preparation Phase
## Weekend 1: Research & Setup

	•	Research tools/APIs needed:
	•	ShazamKit for song recognition or alternatives.
	•	Spotify Web API for playlist integration.
	•	Install development tools and libraries on your MacBook Air:
	•	Ensure Node.js, Python, or another preferred programming environment is installed.
	•	Set up Android SDK and USB debugging for your Pixel 8.
	•	Explore authentication for Spotify (OAuth flow) and any SDK or API for detecting audio from your Pixel 8.

### Development Phase

## Weekend 2: Song Recognition

	•	Build a simple app/script to recognize songs:
	•	Implement ShazamKit or its alternative.
	•	Test song detection with your Pixel’s microphone.
	•	Ensure the detected song’s metadata (e.g., title, artist) is captured.

 ## Weekend 3: Spotify Playlist Integration

	•	Create a basic script/app that authenticates with Spotify and adds a test song to a custom playlist.
	•	Explore creating or using existing Spotify playlists programmatically.

## Weekend 4: Combine Features

	•	Integrate song recognition and Spotify API.
	•	Test end-to-end functionality:
	1.	Play a song on your Pixel 8.
	2.	Detect the song using your app.
	3.	Add it to a specified Spotify playlist.

### Optimization & Testing

## Weekend 5: Error Handling & Edge Cases

	•	Handle common issues:
	•	Song not recognized.
	•	Playlist not found.
	•	API rate limits.
	•	Improve UI/UX if building an app.

## Weekend 6: Final Testing & Deployment

	•	Conduct extensive testing with different songs and playlists.
	•	Set up a method to run the script/app conveniently (e.g., via a shortcut on your Pixel 8 or Mac).
